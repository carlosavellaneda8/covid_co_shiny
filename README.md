# Covid-19 Shiny App
This Shiny app was developed to visualize the results of a SIR model applied to Colombia and Bogot√°. It allows to set different parameters and see how the results change. Also it allows to compare two scenarios and their respective outcomes. The model implemented is based on the code provided by INS (https://www.ins.gov.co/Noticias/Paginas/Coronavirus.aspx).
